# Back-end Assignment

## Overview
This document details the back-end solution developed for the assignment, outlining the ideas, approach, and technologies/packages employed to create a robust API.

## Ideas and Approach
The back-end was designed to be a reliable and efficient counterpart to the front-end. A focus on clarity and simplicity guided the development of a well-documented API, ensuring seamless integration with the front-end.To enhance user-friendliness, the back-end gives the details of the failed records. This approach not only keeps users informed about potential issues in their uploaded data but also provides a straightforward and interactive way to address and correct any errors.

## How to Run
To run the back-end, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the 'back-end' directory
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run start:dev` to start the Nest.js server

## Technologies Used

### 1. Nest.js
Nest.js was selected for its modular architecture and TypeScript support, providing a scalable and maintainable foundation for the project.

### 2. Swagger
The inclusion of Swagger enhances API accessibility through clear and comprehensive documentation, promoting ease of understanding and integration.

### 3. xml2js and csv-parse packages
For parsing XML and CSV files, the `xml2js` and `csv-parse` packages were chosen for their reliability and straightforward usage, ensuring a smooth data processing pipeline.
